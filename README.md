Research title: *The cognitive processing od Serbian derived nouns with ambiguous and unambiguous suffixes.*

This **psycholinguistics study** was aimed at the experimental investigation of *the cognitive processing of Serbian derived nouns with ambiguous derivational suffixes* in **the visual lexical decision task**, one of the tasks which is most commonly used in the language processing research. **Two dependent variables** are measured in this study: **Reaction Time** (measured in millisecond) and **Accuracy** (true/false). In the first step of data analysis, in accordance with the type of dependent variable, **two different statistical analysis** were performed: **Linear Mixed-Effect Regression** (*LMER* -- for RT) and **Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Regression** (*GLMER* -- for Accuracy). The first analysis was selected as appropriate for **continuous dependent variable**, while the second one was selected as a suitable one for **categorical dependent variable**. After gain an insight into the fact that almost all covatiates are nonlinear, and that distribution of data (RTs) is problematic even after the transformation of raw data, a significantly more powerful statistical analysis is applied, the one that is less sensitive to these problems **Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling** (*GAMMs* -- for RT) (for details see Wood, 2006). All codes are written in the **R**.
