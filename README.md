# AdvancedStatistics_UniversityOfFrankfurt
During the winter semester 2019/2020 (November, 2019) I lectured at the course "Advanced Statistics in R" at the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany. On this GH page you can find most of the code we used at the course, contact me for handouts, presentations and data sets.
